# xmljs
XMLjs is a set of classes that make it easier to work with XML within the browser.

We wanted to be able to validate [XAdES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAdES) in the browser, specifically so we could validate the signature on the [EU Trust List](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/tl-create).

This lead us to the creation od XMLDSIGjs which allows us to validate XML and [XAdESjs](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/xadesjs) which extends it and enables us to validate XAdES signatures.

We use XMLjs to make the creation of these libraries easier, though you may find it valuable in your own projects we did not necessarily have you in mind when we created it, at least directly.
